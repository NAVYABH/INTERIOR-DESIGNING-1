    <h2 class="one" style="text-align: center;">What elements should I consider for designing my kitchen?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">There are a lot of factors that you need to consider when you plan to design a new kitchen or remodel it. A kitchen is often the hub of the home, so it is very important to get it right, otherwise, it is heartbreaking. Kitchen remodelling needs more thought than picking a few colours and materials. There are many factors that you need to consider such as

        Your Budget:  You need to decide on a maximum budget for the project and choose crucial elements such as flooring, kitchen cabinets and countertops before you select anything else. If you need to keep costs down, perhaps you can retain the current kitchen layout and replace the cabinet doors, fixtures and fittings. You also need to plan whether you’ll do the work yourself or need to hire an interior designer who can help you out.</p>
    <h2 class="one" style="text-align: center;">What colour should I use for my kitchen?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">When it's time to choose the colours for your kitchen, make sure you first take a moment to think about the mission of the kitchen - if you are really looking for excitement or it is the room more for helping you find a sense of peace? If it is a modern kitchen, do you want it to be your space to invent and conduct experiments - or are you and your family looking for a room that appears to be a great spot for entertaining? 

        The heart of the home, the kitchen, must appeal the tastes of many. When it comes to learning how to paint your home's heart, choosing the right kitchen colours is everything. Use some spicy, warm kitchen colours, such as red, orange and yellow, that relate to food and offer appetising surroundings. Use cooler, serene kitchen paint colours like green, blue and violet to create a calm and fresh atmosphere. A simple colour change can definitely update your kitchen in major ways. The right shade of grey, for sure, can turn the room from drab to sophisticated and the red can take it from overwhelming to perfectly dramatic. Most people, of course, start their days in their kitchens, and white can really energise a room. It feels fresh and clean, and an all-white kitchen will definitely wake you up the minute you step in it. You can also have more fun with your countertops and backsplash in an all-white kitchen and choose brighter colours or designs for those. And  when you are finally ready, move on to our kitchen planners for advice. They are based all over India and can help you out with the designs that appeal the most to you.</p>
    <h2 class="one" style="text-align: center;">Ideas for small kitchens</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">If you have a small kitchen, you definitely need big ideas in order to make the best use of the small space. White is a colour which can make a small space look big. So, for a start, try to paint the kitchen walls white. Use light colours for furniture and cabinets because darker colours make it look shabby and small. Try to fit in all the kitchen items and appliances inside the cabinet. This will make it look cleaner and neater. Do not over-burden your kitchen with furniture and accessories. You can get amazing kitchen design ideas at homify which will definitely inspire you to redecorate your kitchen immediately.</p>
    <h2 class="one" style="text-align: center;">What’s your style? </h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Kitchen styles come in many varieties and you must have a strong idea about how you’d like your new kitchen to look. There are many fun and funky kitchens with bright colours but you need to design it based on the kitchen space available. If you’re still in need of inspiration you can find amazing ideas in homify for the types of kitchens that appeal to you in order to get beautiful ideas. Think about what sort of kitchen would be appropriate for the style/age of your home.</p>
